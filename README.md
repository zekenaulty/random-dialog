# random-dialog
test app please ignore... nah it's just my own tinkering in the same vein as [ui-bootstrap](https://angular-ui.github.io/bootstrap/), it's not as feature complete, but it was fun to make.

# Development Tool 
I developed, debugged, and deployed this little angular app on my phone using [spck editor](https://spck-code-editor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Spck only allows 50 files per git repo, challenge accepted ;p

# Status
styles for ngClass is still not integrated. styles.css still needs clean-up and to be factored out into templates per component.

# TODO
add navbar component for external modules, debug, write tests

browser testing and fixes
